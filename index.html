					<p class="project-details__desc">
						Botium Toys, a growing U.S. toy company with an expanding online
						market, initiated an internal IT audit to strengthen its security
						posture and ensure compliance with industry and international
						regulations. Using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, the IT manager
						outlined the audit scope, goals, and risk assessment. The task is to
						review this information and complete a controls & compliance
						checklist to identify security gaps, risks, and areas for
						improvement.
					</p>

					<h2 class="modal__section-titles">Scope</h2>
					<p class="project-details__desc">
						The scope of this audit is defined as the entire security program at
						Botium Toys. This includes their assets like employee equipment and
						devices, their internal network, and their systems. The requirement
						is to review Botium Toys' assets and evaulate existing controls and
						compliance practices.

						Assess existing assets and complete the controls and compliance

					<div class="project-details__desc">
						<h3 class="modal__section-subtitles">Risk Description</h3>
						<p class="project-details__desc">
							Currently, there is inadequate management of assets. Additionally,
							Botium Toys does not have all of the proper controls in place and

							and standards.
						</p>

						<h3 class="modal__section-subtitles">Control Best Practices</h3>
						<p class="project-details__desc">
							The first of the five functions of the NIST CSF is Identify.
							Botium Toys will need to dedicate resources to identify assets so
							they can appropriately manage them. Additionally, they will need
							to classify existing assets and determine the impact of the loss
							of existing assets, including systems, on business continuity.
						</p>

						<h3 class="modal__section-subtitles">Risk Score</h3>
						<p class="project-details__desc">
							On a scale of 1 to 10, the risk score is 8, which is fairly high.

						To investigate the incident, the IT department attempted to visit

						<h3 class="modal__section-subtitles">Network Protocol Analysis</h3>
						<p class="project-details__desc">
							The network protocol involved in the brute force attack was HTTP.
							Since the website was using an unsecured protocol, it was easier
							for the malicious actor to perform an attack by accessing the
							admin panel and changing the source code.
						</p>

						<h3 class="modal__section-subtitles">Incident Documentation</h3>
						<p class="project-details__desc">
							Several customers reported that the company’s website prompted a
							file download, redirected them to "greatrecipesforme.com", and
							caused their computers to slow down. Investigation identified a
							brute force attack that allowed the attacker to access the website
							and modify its source code.

							<br /><br />

							The security team reproduced the issue in a sandbox environment
							using a network protocol analyzer, confirming the download prompt
							and subsequent redirection.

							<br /><br />

							Tcpdump logs showed that the browser resolved
							"yummyrecipesforme.com" via DNS, requested the webpage, initiated
							the malware download, and then resolved and accessed the malicious
							website ("greatrecipesforme.com"), completing the HTTP request.

							<br /><br />

							Further analysis revealed that a malicious JavaScript code was
							embedded in the website's source code, prompting users to download
							an executable file. The use of HTTP left the connection unsecured,
							increasing vulnerability to attacks, and no controls were in place
							to prevent brute force attempts.

					<h2 class="modal__section-titles">Scenario</h2>
					<p class="project-details__desc">
						A multimedia company recently experienced a distributed
						denial-of-service (DDoS) attack that disrupted internal network
						operations for two hours.

						<br /><br />

						The attack involved a flood of ICMP packets that overwhelmed the
						network services and prevented access to internal resources. The
						incident management team responded by blocking incoming ICMP
						packets, stopping all non-critical network services offline, and
						restoring critical network services.

						<br /><br />

						Investigation later confirmed that the attack exploited an
						unconfigured firewall, allowing the malicious attacker to penetrate
						the company network.
					</p>

					<h2 class="modal__section-titles">Analysis using NIST CSF</h2>
					<div class="project-details__desc">
						<h3 class="modal__section-subtitles">Identify</h3>
						<p class="project-details__desc">
							The investigation revealed that an unconfigured firewall was used
							by the malicious actor to exploit the company network with DDoS
							attacks, specifically the Ping of Death. Additionally, the absence
							of intrusion detection and prevention systems prevented timely
							detection and alerting of the attack.
						</p>

						<h3 class="modal__section-subtitles">Protect</h3>
						<p class="project-details__desc">
							The security team strengthened the company's internal networks by
							implementing a new firewall to limit the rate of incoming ICMP
							packets, a source IP verification to check for spoofed IP
							addresses on incoming ICMP packets, a network monitoring software
							to detect abnormal traffic patterns, and an IDS/IPS system to
							filter ICMP traffic.
						</p>

						<h3 class="modal__section-subtitles">Detect</h3>
						<p class="project-details__desc">
							The security team implemented an IDS/IPS system to filter incoming
							ICMP traffic based on suspicious characteristics / patterns and
							for better alerting when malicious attacks occur.

							<br /><br />

							Additionally, the organization can leverage SIEM dashboards and
							tools, tcpdump logs, and network log analyzer to monitor malicious
							activities.

							<br /><br />

							System logging and monitoring, combined with security hardening
							procedures such as regular software updates / patches, disabling
							unused ports, reducing access permissions, and using MFA, can help
							identify abnormal network behavior and ensure that only authorized
							users have access to the internal network.
						</p>

						<h3 class="modal__section-subtitles">Respond</h3>
						<p class="project-details__desc">
							To address the incident and avoid further impact, the security
							team blocked the incoming ICMP packets, took all non-critical
							network services offline, and restored critical network services.

							<br /><br />

							The team also deployed a new firewall to limit the rate of
							incoming ICMP packets, enabled a source IP verification to check
							for spoofed IP addresses, implemented a network monitoring
							software to detect abnormal traffic patterns, and activated an
							IDS/IPS system to filter suspicious ICMP activity.
						</p>

						<h3 class="modal__section-subtitles">Recover</h3>
						<p class="project-details__desc">
							The security team successfully restored normal network operations
							within 2 hours by performing thorough investigation and
							implementing the necessary controls to stop the DDoS attacks from
							compromising the internal network.

							<br /><br />

							To improve response and recovery for future incidents, the
							organization implemented an IDS/IPS system to enhance detection,
							monitoring, and response to similar attacks. In addition, the use
							of SIEM tools, tcpdump logs, and network log analyzer supports
							faster and more effective incident resolution.
