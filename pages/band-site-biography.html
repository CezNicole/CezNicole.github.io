					“We push each other to be the best. It’s not uncommon for one of us to
					say ‘this needs to be better, back to the drawing board’” - Lead
					vocalist of The Bees Knees
				</blockquote>

				<h3>The Bees Knees</h3>
				<p>
					The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating from San Francisco,
					California. The band consists a dynamic lineup featuring two lead
					vocalists, two guitarists, a bassist, a keyboardist and a drummer. The
					band achieved its first commercial success as an unsigned act, drawing
					attention from their future manager. Having extensive experience
					working with both new and seasoned acts, the manager was confident the
					band could succeed even further with more support, pushing The Bees
					Knees to sign with a well known record label.
				</p>
				<p>
					From there, the band has soared, gaining international recognition and
					ranking in the top 10 on the Poster Charts. New fans immediately fell
					in love with the band’s original and organic attitude, solidifying
					their place as one of the hottest and fastest up and coming acts of
					this century. Fans affectionately refer to themselves as “The Hive”
					and are drawn to their candid and authentic performances on stage. The
					Bees Knees are currently recording their second studio album, looking
					to be released in early 2024.
